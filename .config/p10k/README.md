# Powerlevel10k config
[Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) custom configuration directory.

The default directory/file for Powerlevel10k is $HOME/.p10k.zsh. It was overwritten by `POWERLEVEL9K_CONFIG_FILE` [environment variable](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k/issues/967):

`POWERLEVEL9K_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/file p10k configure`

After the initial setup this variable can be safely ignored. Powerlevel10k will remeber it.
